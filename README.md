# Course Registration Planner

A Python-based course registration planner that models prerequisites as a directed graph,
detects cycles, and generates valid semester-by-semester schedules using heap-based prioritization.

## Key Features
- Models course prerequisites using a directed graph
- Detects invalid prerequisite cycles
- Computes course depth to prioritize scheduling
- Generates a registration plan with up to 4 courses per semester
- Includes a full unit test suite

## Technologies
- Python
- Graph algorithms (DFS, topological ordering)
- Binary heap (priority queue)
- Unit testing (unittest)

## Context
Built as part of coursework at The University of Texas at Austin to practice graph-based
problem solving and algorithm design.
